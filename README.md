## Thesis/Project FAQ
This is a curated list of frequently asked questions for a thesis with __Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Frank-Michael Schleif__ at the __Faculty of Computer Science and Business Information Systems__ of the __University of Applied Sciences Wuerzburg-Schweinfurt__:


### Organization

* What is the process to start a thesis?

    1. Read through all the provided documents and this FAQ list
    2. Get in touch with Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Frank-Michael Schleif
    3. Submit a topic proposal (see the files in this repository for guidelines)
    4. Discuss the proposal with us
    5. We will officially register the thesis topic with you

* How much time do I have for my thesis?

    In case we officially register your thesis within the first month of each semester (October/March-April), you have a deadline of 5 months, otherwise 3 months.

* How is the thesis graded?

    The grade consists of the following parts:
    - Thesis 
    - Implementation (public in github/gitlab)
    - Bachelor's seminar and thesis defense (25 min + discussion)
    
* Is is possible to write the thesis abroad?

    Yes, it is possible. However, all procedures need more time than usual (visa, partner abroad, ...). Therefore, the thesis must be planned well in advance (we recommend one year). 
    
* Is there a bachelor's seminar?

    Yes, usually 4-6 weeks after the start of the semester.
    
* Is there a master's seminar?

    No, not as of now. This may be subject to change depending on the semester.
        
### Thesis
* What prior knowledge is expected?

    - Englisch (At least the literature ist in English)
    - Programming (Strong theoretical and practical background)
    - Math (Formulas are expected in the thesis)
    - (recommended) ML / Data analytics or alike (FWPM, international teaching week)
    
* What is the expected output of the thesis?
    
    First and foremost, we expect the thesis to adhere to scientific standards. The ultimate ambition should be to have the work in a form ready for submission to a workshop or conference. A submission to a workshop or conference will be considered in grading.
    
* How long should my thesis be?
  
    The page count of a thesis depends largely on the topic and the writing style. In general, less than 40 pages and more than 60 pages can be a sign that the thesis topic is not well enough addressed or the writing style is not to the point.

* What language should my thesis be written in?

    We strongly recommend to write your thesis in English, as this corresponds to scientific standards. German is possible, but not recommended.

* How should I write my thesis? Is there a template?

   The thesis is expected to be submitted in LaTeX. [A corresponding overleaf template can be found here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tmccpbcttyfs).

* Is an implementation required?
 
    Yes, implementation is always expected. However, depending on the focus of the work, this part may be more or less emphasized.
    
* What programming language should the code in my thesis be written in? What frameworks can I use?

    As the topic of the thesis is in the area of AI/ML, we accept implementations in the languages commonly used in this domain, i.e., Python or Matlab. As for frameworks, we strongly recommend Pytorch, Pytorch Ligthning or SKlearn.

* Can I provide own topics or do an industry topic?

    Yes, it is possible. Please submit a proposal and present the topic in advance. For industry topics, we strongly recommend the 5-month deadline and/or prior employment with the company. Please also check the special requirements for ML/DL topics.
    Furthermore, it is necessary to fill out the [confirmation form](https://github.com/AGCI-Wuerzburg/agci_thesis_and_projects/blob/82b9f5a06f7ae6a0daf2fb472a8d3a36ad3691fa/Company_Confirmation.pdf) in German or English. In case the thesis should only be disclosed to the first and second reviewers and authorized members of the board of examiners, please fill out the [confidential clause](https://github.com/AGCI-Wuerzburg/agci_thesis_and_projects/blob/fbe7d7433499ece478a0f664a852e1e07952a30a/Company_Confidential_Clause.pdf). This text should be on the first pages of the thesis (not the title page). Please note that for legal reasons, the University cannot sign other forms of NDAs.
    
* Are there special requirements for ML/DL topics?
    
    The most critical part of AI topics is usually the data. Make sure you have access to the data throughout the duration of the work and that the data is in an appropriate form.
    
* Are DL topics possible?
    
    Yes. We also have the necessary technical support in the form of hardware. However, the topic of the thesis must be carefully examined beforehand.
